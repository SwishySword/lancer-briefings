# HERCYNIA, EVERGREEN // 4.19.5014u
**PATIENCE** calls the Task Force to a meeting, and things get tense as he notes their suspicious behavior.  After a request to have more trust, the meeting begins and he reveals that he has repurposed a local weather satellite for broad theatre intelligence gathering.  He notes the movement of hostile forces to the north, and requests the lancers be on high alert.

Moments after the meeting's end, explosions rock the colony as a large-scale assault on **EVERGREEN** commences.  The southern wall is hit hard, with the eastern gate taking heavy casualties.  The lancers mobilize and head for their frames, only to discover **AYLA** is missing.
