# HERCYNIA, EVERGREEN // 4.19.5014u
**PATIENCE** calls the Task Force to a meeting, and things get tense as he notes their suspicious behavior.  After a request to have more trust, the meeting begins and he reveals that he has repurposed a local weather satellite for broad theatre intelligence gathering.  He notes the movement of hostile forces to the north, and requests the lancers be on high alert.

Moments after the meeting's end, explosions rock the colony as a large-scale assault on **EVERGREEN** commences.  The southern wall is hit hard, with the eastern gate taking heavy casualties.  The lancers mobilize and head for their frames, only to discover **AYLA** is missing.

The Task Force moves to defend the eastern gate when **AYLA** confirms with **PATIENCE** that the militia lacks the firepower to hold the position from the raiders.  She notes that she suspects the enemy intends to take the **OMNITOWER** to take control of communications, and suggests the Task Force move quickly to disable the attackers so they can prevent this.

Defending the gate is **BRAVA HEDURA** and **PVT. NOVEM** along with a squad of subalterns and the automated MLRS towers on the wall.  Over several minutes of intense fighting, the group learns from overheard communications that the attack on the gates are a diversion as expected, but not to target the **OMNITOWER**.  Rather, they have a group moving to assault the **STABLE REACTOR TOWER**s and have nearly accomplished their goal.

They warn **PATIENCE**, too late to stop the ambush at the first reactor tower but quick enough to get a defense mustered at the second.  The enemies withdraw before the Task Force can eliminate them all, retreating to the tree line to prevent pursuit.  A militia truck driven by **PVT. ELI BENETTON** arrives and the Task Force along with the milita forces board and race to defend the reactors.

They arrive in time to see the attackers pushing into the **STABLE REACTOR TOWER** zone, engaged with **LT. COL. ZEB MAROWSKI** (better known as "Firehose"), **PVT. DANIEL ERICKSON** (better known as "Yesman"), engineer **YUUKI WELLINGTON** and two squads of subalterns.  Even with the heavy machinegun emplacement, it is clear the group is about to be overrun.  The Task Force deploys to assist.
