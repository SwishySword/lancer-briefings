# HERCYNIA, EVERGREEN // 2.22.5014u
The task force arrives on Hercynia, descending in the midst of a storm.  Colony reports the storm has knocked out the **LANDING BOWL** and redirects them 2 klicks south to land.  There they are greeted by **BRAVA HADURA**, commander of Evergreen's militia.  She informs the squad to keep low due to the presence of a sniper.  **KIT** elects to hide themselves with their stealth hardsuit, while **TORQUE** rushes ahead to the colony.

During their trip, the task force learns that the attacks have been going on for **HALF A YEAR** prior to their arrival.  Most of the militia are antsy, and unequipped mentally or materially for the scale of fighting they've seen.  Several claim that it's not men they're fighting, but aliens called **EGREGORIANS** back from the annals of the planet's myths.  The attackers have been through and brutal, burning down entire homesteads and tearing them apart on distinctly vicious manners.

**HEPHAESTUS** determines that the wood here is extremely flammable due to a waxy sheen most plantlife has adopted to avoid being drowned by the excessive rains.  Any fire set in the forest is likely to rapidly grow out of control.

**COSMA** and **KIT** learn that the buildings here are mostly temporary shelters, and that the rain on **HERCYNIA** is slightly acidic.  Enough that prolonged exposure to it can cause pitting and decay.

**GERALD** learns that the people here are frightened, but generally have faith in **PATIENCE**, the NHP managing **EVERGREEN** to see them through.

Things take a dark turn when the sniper opens fire upon the task force, clipping **COSMA** with a near-miss and nearly killing her.  **GERALD** rushes to her aid, shielding her body with his own as he attempts to pick her up.  **AYLA** takes a shot with her rifle, but the shot goes wide due to wind and distance.  Thankfully, no further attacks followed up the initial attack, and the task force makes it to the **GOVERNER'S FARM**.

There they meet **EDNA JI**, and find **TORQUE** awiting them.  **EDNA JI** is **PATIENCE**'s attach√©, and she leads the task force to the office where they meet the NHP himself.  **PATIENCE** takes the form of an elderly gentleman, offers them drinks and food before briefing them on the situation.  He confirms the attacks have been happening for months, but suspects these are human raiders and not aliens despite what his militia claims.  As proof he offers the testimony of a survivor from an earlier battle, **PVT. NOVEM**, and video of said engagement.  Though the details are hard to make out due to the frantic nature of combat, visually they confirm the presence of a mech and the corpse of one of the raiders.

**HEPHAESTUS** asks for information on **EGREGORIANS** and a sample of their shell, which **PATIENCE** provides readily.  The shell seems to be equivalent to hardened steel on touch, with a strange pattern on it that seems to have no purpose.  **GERALD** asks for more details on the attacks, and he and **AYLA** visibly do not approve of **PATIENCE**'s thoughts regarding the non-**EVERGREEN** homesteads and towns in the wilds.  **KIT** focuses their efforts on seeking information and electronic weakpoints, and discovers that much of the colony's infrastructure has shifted to hardlines over wireless.

Briefed in full, the task force is offered rooms at the **BOTTOM OF THE WELL** and promised their frames would be printed overnight at the **PRINTSHOP**.  Before they disperse **EDNA JI** offers them a tour of the **GOVERNER'S FARM**, which also turns into a request from her to record their next mission in order to provide **PATIENCE** with practical data for managing colony forces.  (SEE: **SIDE MISSION // #001a**)  On the training field, **TORQUE** offers pointers to the militia and receives a request from **BRAVA HEDURA** for a copy of their fight next mission as well, hoping to use their experience to provide pointers to the colonial forces.  (SEE: **SIDE MISSION // #001b**)  **KIT** and **HEPHAESTUS** work on a tracking device requested by **AYLA**.  **GERALD** heads to talk with the engineers, meeting with chief engineer **CASTOR FIELDING** who is more than happy to talk. Once satisfied with their progress, **KIT** opts to check on the **PRINTSHOP** and finds both **GERALD** and **CASTOR FIELDING**, who is excited to talk shop with someone who knows what's up.  He shows them a project's been working on, the **PLASMA MAUL**, and suggests he could produce more of them if he had some reference materials to work out the kinks.  (SEE: **SIDE MISSION // #001c)**

Now equipped with her tracker, **AYLA** opts to go hunting alone and try to find the sniper and their crew before the mission proper.  She searches through the forest, limited by the darkness and rain but skilled enough to find and follow those tracks all the same.  She finds several patterns that meet up with the tracks she follows, and pins them down to a clearing southeast of the transmission tower south of **EVERGREEN**.  Spotting strange lights in the distance, she opts to divert for a moment and check that out.  There she finds a pile of burned subalterns, dumped into a heap and set alight.  She continues to search for signs of the attackers, but pulls back when she sees strange lights and gets an eerie feeling.

# HERCYNIA, EVERGREEN // 2.23.5014u
The task force departs at dawn, with **AYLA**'s mech slaved to **GERALD**'s commands in her absence.  They follow the trail she blazed, and her tracker.  There they find **AYLA** returned to the clearing, just in time to discover the tracks they were following the night before were in fact bait for an ambush.

Getting a clear look at their attackers for the first time, they confirm **PATIENCE**'s supposition that the raiders are human.  Piloting old frames patchworked together, the enemy put up a fight but the lancers proved their skill by dismantling the ambush in only a handful of seconds with brutal efficiency.  By the end of it several "**EGREGORIANS**" were dead, with the sniper captured.  A secondary force arrived, but ordered a withdrawal rather than fight at **AYLA**'s demand for surrender.  If not for **KIT**, **HEPHAESTUS**, and **COSMA**'s omnistream chat, they might not have understood the particularly ancient dialect used by the raiders.

The task force took several more potshots are the fleeing forces, some for intimidation, others to vent their anger, while **AYLA** used the cover of their retreat to plant the tracker on the Support-class frame the ambush had brought with them.
