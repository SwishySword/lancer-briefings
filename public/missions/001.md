# Mission // #001

## Bug-Hunt
# Goals
- Stabilize the situation around Evergreen.
- Track the raiders, figure out who they are.
  - Stop their attacks.

# Enemy OPFOR
- Unknown combatants at least equal to the Task Force in size.
  - Reinforcements for enemies likely.

# Stakes
- Time is critical. Failure, or not acting, will result in Evergreen losing contact with surrounding farmland, crippling any kind of expansion.

# Reserves
- None at this time.

## Operation: Widowmaker
- The Task Force has elected to try and track down the sniper plaguing Evergreen.  Shutting dow the sniper attacs will allow the militia some time to breathe and maneuver.  May potentially be able to recover arms and armour from the raiders.

## Operation: The Horde
- Priority alert redirected the Task Force to the southern farms and area of Grey Towns.  Heavy communications distruption.
