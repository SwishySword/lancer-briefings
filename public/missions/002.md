# Mission // #002
## Vigilant Gaze

Patience puts the colony at its maximum security level and asks the squad to be on high alert. They are asked to stay around the colony while Evergreen scouts try to predict the movements of the Hercynian raiders.  
Before anyone can gather more intel, a nighttime attack on the colony forces the team into action.

# Goals
- Defend Evergreen and protect Evergreen’s reactor.

# Enemy OPFOR
- Significant mobile frame forces estimated between 20-40 in strength, split into multiple groups.  Frame-based artillery, snipers, heavy machine guns.
  - Reinforcements not expected due to amount of personnel present.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, Evergreen’s reactors will be destroyed, forcing the colony to use backup power, demolishing its defenses and its ability to function.

# Reserves
- None at this time.

## Operation: Night Strike
- The Task Force elected to assist Evergreen's eastern gate, sending Hephaestus to support the southern gate for a couple of minutes before rejoining the Task Force.

## Operation: Reactor Defense
- The Task Force learned from raider chatter the attacks on the gates were distractions, not soon enough to prevent them but early enough that defenses were moved in place to hold the ambush from overrunning both reactors.  They now race to support the defense of the remaining reactor tower.
