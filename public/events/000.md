# UNS Dandelion // 1.03.5014u
The squad finally met each other en-route to the recently-rediscovered planetoid known as **HERCYNIA**. Called by UAD Administrator **CHAI HEDURA**, Task Force **ECHO-ALPHA-ECHO-OMEGA** was sent on the light patrol ship **UNS DANDELION**. 

Known so far:

Approximately two months ago a distress call was received from **EVERGREEN**, a colony on the planet **HERCYNIA** in the **ATLAS** line, seeking aid against unidentified aggressors.

**EVERGREEN** is under the administration of **LANDMARK COLONIAL**, a minor subsidary corporation of **SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO**.  First objective is to make contact with local LC Representative and integrate into local hierarchy.

Situation on-ground is to be treated with utmost care.  Recent investigation suggests possibility of extant human populations on **HERCYNIA** unreported by LC. Task Force is advised not to reveal these suspicions to LC Personnel unless deemed necessary.

Further research has yielded little information about **HERCYNIA'S** history prior to the founding of **EVERGREEN**.  Data suggests Hercynia was once subject to widespread and catastrophic military action by **SECCOMM**, though records lack meaningful detail.  Recent scans show large irradiated zones on planetary surface, as well as decayed and encrypted communications broadcasting on-loop.  Task Force should expect to encounter remnants of **SECCOMM** presence: unexploded ordinance, waste radiation, and potentially even derelict military installations.
